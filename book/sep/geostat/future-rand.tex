In this paper I glossed over several problems.
First, $\sigma$ should be a space-varying function rather than
the constant I proposed. A bootstrap approach (using
the model residual at one non-linear iteration as our guess
at a space-varying $\sigma$) might prove effective but hasn't been
tested.  How to calculate $\sigma$ for the non-missing data problem
is an open question. In the generic geophysical operator $\bf L$, we often
don't know
which model components are estimated through the data fitting
goal and which are estimated by the model styling goal.
Finally, I made the  assumption that I was dealing with
models with  a normal distribution. 
Whether replacing $\bf v$ with another distribution
or using something similar to the geostatistician's {\it normal-score transform}
would be effective in correctly modeling these distributions is unknown.
