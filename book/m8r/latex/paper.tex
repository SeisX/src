\chapter{Writing reproducible papers, books, and reports}

Chapter~\ref{chapter:scons} describes some of the SCons tools used by
Madagascar users to write papers, books, and reports with reproducible
examples. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at an example paper.

\section{Overview of \LaTeX and SEG\TeX}

\LaTeX is a document markup language developed originally by Leslie
Lamport in early 1980s \cite[]{latex} as an extension of Donuld
Knuth's \TeX system \cite[]{tex}. \LaTeX is widely used in different
fields of science and engineering.

\LaTeX files are text files that can be edited in regular text
editors. Similarly to HTML and Markdown, \LaTeX is a descriptive
language: one can learn it by example following other \LaTeX
documents. As of 2016, the Madagascar package contains more than 200
papers and book chapters written in \LaTeX. You can find the source of
this chapter in
\href{https://github.com/ahay/src/blob/master/book/m8r/latex/paper.tex}
     {\$RSFSRC/book/m8r/latex/paper.tex}
and attached in the appendix.

SEG\TeX is a collection of \LaTeX macros developed for geophysical
publications, such as \emph{Geophysics} articles, SEG (Society of
Exploration Geophysicists) Annual Meeting abstracts, etc. SEG\TeX is
an open-source project maintained by a group of volunteers. It
integrates well with Madagascar to support the practice of
\emph{reproducible research}, as formulated by Jon Claerbout: ...

\LaTeX processing scripts included with Madagascar can turn a single
document into multiple outputs: paper in a journal, chapter in a book,
an expanded abstract for a conference, etc. It can also produce
multiple output formats, namely PDF and HTML.

\section{SCons processing}

Handling \LaTeX documents in Madagascar is made easier with customized
SCons rules provided in \texttt{rsf.tex} package (for handling
individual papers) and \texttt{rsf.book} package (for handling books
and reports).

If a \LaTeX paper file has the name
\texttt{article.tex}, the \texttt{SConstruct} script for processing it
may look like
\lstset{language=python,showstringspaces=false,frame=single}
\begin{lstlisting}
  from rsf.tex import *

  Paper('article',use='amsmath',options='10pt')
\end{lstlisting}
After running
\begin{verbatim}
scons article.pdf
\end{verbatim}
the paper will be processed to generate a PDF document.

According to
the Madagascar convention, the source LaTeX file
(\texttt{article.tex}) does not contain the usual preamble
\texttt{\\documentclass} information, as well as
\texttt{\\begin{document}} and \texttt{\\end{document}} commands. This
  is done so that the same paper could be easily integrated into a
  collection of papers in a report or as a chapter in a book. Running \texttt{scons article.pdf} generates an intermediate file \texttt{article.ltx}, which contains the following preamble:
\lstset{language=tex,showstringspaces=false,frame=single}
\begin{lstlisting}
  \documentclass[10pt]{geophysics}
  \usepackage{amsmath}
  \begin{document}
\end{lstlisting}
  and ends with
\begin{lstlisting}
  \end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
  
Several optional arguments can be supplied to the \texttt{Paper()} command:
\begin{description}
\item[source=] specifies
\item[lclass=] specifies
\item[scons=] specifies
\item[use=] specifies
\item[include=] specifies
\item[options=] specifies
\end{description}
Some additional arguments control the placement of reproducible
figures and are described in the next section.

earlier at SEP (Stanford Exploration Project) for implementing Jon
Claerbout's vision of reproducible research \cite[]{sep}.
