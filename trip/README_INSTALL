      *** Installation of TRIP Software in Madagascar ***

0. Contents

rvl - framework for linking complex simulations with optimization and
numerical linear algebra

iwave - framework for timestepping simulators, with RVL hooks

test - regression test package, depends on GoogleTest. Useful mainly
for code maintainers/developers. Not installed from any top level
install, either local or global - install must be run within the test
directory.

1. Global Install

TRIP software installs as part of a global Madagascar install, with
the standard conventions - commands begin with "sf..." and move to
the Madagascar bin directory defined at configuration.

2. Local install

It is also possible to build the TRIP packages locally, either all of
them together by executing "scons" in this directory, or individually
by executing "scons" in the package root (iwave, rvl,...). Locally
built executables are stored with their source in main subdirs, with
suffix .x.

Default options for local build are -g and no optimization.

To build locally with other options (higher optimization level, MPI,
...)  create a file named config.py defining these options, after the
fashion of the RSFSRC/config.py file. Note that only C/C++ related
options are relevant. The admin subdirectory contains several
examples. For MPI, the example config.pys presume that the MPI bin
directory has been placed in your path.  Place config.py (the name is
important!) in this directory (i.e. in RSFSRC/trip), then scons.
